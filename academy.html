                        <p>Throughout the program, you'll work on mastering six carefully selected songs that span different genres and styles. These songs have been chosen to showcase various techniques, chord progressions, and musical elements, providing you with a well-rounded musical experience.</p>
                        <p>To aid your learning process, we provide worksheets that accompany each song. These worksheets break down the song structure, highlight important chords and progressions, and offer additional exercises to reinforce your understanding. You'll also have access to high-quality backing tracks, allowing you to practice playing along with a full band or accompaniment.</p>
                        <p>Our video lessons serve as your personal instructor, guiding you through each song and technique.
