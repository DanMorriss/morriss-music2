                <h2>About Daniel Morriss</h2>
                <img  id="dan-image" class="photo photo-avatar" src="assets/images/dan-avatar1.png" alt="Dan playing the Mandolin">
                <div id="dan-bio">
                    <p class="fade-in">Daniel first picked up the bass guitar at 13 and began lessons with legendary bass player Brian Gregg (Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Bob Dylan, The Tornadoes). This cemented his love for making music and led him to study BTEC Music Performance and achieve Grade 8 in the bass and guitar.</p>
                    <p class="fade-in">Playing in bands throughout school and college Daniel always enjoyed performing and started touring at 19, spending most of the next 10 years on the road. As a founding member of Echotape he had the chance to tour across Europe, America and Russia and has supported some of his childhood idols including The White Stripes, Queens of the Stone Age and Oceansize.</p>  
                    <p class="fade-in">Daniel's songwriting talents have garnered recognition worldwide, with his compositions receiving airplay and television exposure across the globe. He has experienced the exhilaration of playing sold-out stadium gigs and gracing numerous festivals with his electrifying performances. However, amidst his successful career as a musician, Daniel discovered a newfound passion for teaching, leading him to become a Licentiate of the London College of Music for Guitar Tuition.</p>
                    <p class="fade-in">Currently, Daniel imparts his expertise in electric guitar, acoustic guitar, classical guitar, bass guitar, and ukulele through one-on-one lessons and group sessions. Despite his focus on teaching, Daniel continues to indulge his musical spirit by performing on bass and guitar, collaborating with bands like Ruby Boots and Alibis. As a founding member and esteemed house bass player for the Newbury Jazz Platform, his musical journey continues to evolve and inspire.</p>

                    <h3>Bass Guitar</h3>
                    <p>Bass is the soul of a band, it makes you want to dance and drives the music along while keeping everyone together. As a session player with almost 20 years playing experience I can show you the way bass works in music, by learning some of the greatest ever bass lines and teaching you to lock in with a drummer.</p>
                    <p>We’ll use songs, backing tracks and jam together to make it as enjoyable as possible. You’ll be able to take the RGT bass guitar grades, so far all my students have achieved distinction at Grade 8*.</p>

                    <h3>Ukulele</h3>
                    <p>The ukulele is one of the easiest instruments to learn and a great gateway to many other instruments. Your first chord takes seconds to master and you’ll be strumming along to a song within half an hour.</p>
                    <p>Just because its easy to pick up doesn’t mean that we can’t push ourselves. I have a catalogue of songs specifically arranged for varying difficulty using a variety of techniques including strumming, finger-picking & percussive rhythm playing. All that can be played solo, with the record or as part of a group.</p>
