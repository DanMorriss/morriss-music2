        <p>After writing songs that have been played on radio and television across the globe, playing sold out stadium gigs and numerous festivals Daniel has found a new love for teaching and is a Licentiate of the London College of Music for Guitar Tuition. He teaches the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, classical guitar, bass guitar and the ukulele in one-to-one lessons and group sessions at his studio in Marlborough as well as at Cheam and Brockhurst schools.</p>
