                <div id="dan-bio" class="hide">
                    <p>Daniel first picked up the bass guitar at 13 and began lessons with legendary bass player Brian Gregg (Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Bob Dylan, The Tornadoes). This cemented his love for making music and led him to study BTEC Music Performance and achieve Grade 8 in the bass and guitar.</p>
                    <p>Playing in bands throughout school and college Daniel always enjoyed performing and started touring at 19, spending most of the next 10 years on the road. As a founding member of Echotape he had the chance to tour across Europe, America and Russia and has supported some of his childhood idols including The White Stripes, Queens of the Stone Age and Oceansize.</p>  
                    <p>After writing songs that have been played on radio and television across the globe, playing sold out stadium gigs and numerous festivals Daniel has found a new love for teaching and is a Licentiate of the London College of Music for Guitar Tuition. He teaches the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, classical guitar, bass guitar and the ukulele in one-to-one lessons and group sessions at his studio in Marlborough as well as at Cheam and Brockhurst schools.</p>

                    <p>The classical guitar is a good introduction to the guitar and an excellent opportunity to learn to read.

                    <h3>Bass Guitar</h3>
                    <p>Bass is the soul of a band, it makes you want to dance and drives the music along while keeping everyone together. As a session player with almost 20 years playing experience I can show you the way bass works in music, by learning some of the greatest ever bass lines and teaching you to lock in with a drummer.</p>
                    <p>We’ll use songs, backing tracks and jam together to make it as enjoyable as possible. You’ll be able to take the RGT bass guitar grades, so far all my students have achieved distinction at Grade 8*.</p>

                    <h3>Ukulele</h3>
                    <p>The ukulele is one of the easiest instruments to learn and a great gateway to many other instruments. Your first chord takes seconds to master and you’ll be strumming along to a song within half an hour.</p>
                    <p>Just because its easy to pick up doesn’t mean that we can’t push ourselves. I have a catalogue of songs specifically arranged for varying difficulty using a variety of techniques including strumming, finger-picking & percussive rhythm playing. All that can be played solo, with the record or as part of a group.</p>
